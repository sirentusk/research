        <p>"In all six equations, personality explained variance in disgust sensitivity independent of participant sex and age. For Pathogen Disgust, the two significant andâ€”across personality modelsâ€”consistent personality predictors were Neuroticism/Emotionality and Orderliness/Conscientiousness. For Sexual Disgust, the two consistent personality predictors were Orderliness/Conscientiousness and Honesty-Humility. For Moral Disgust, the two consistent personality predictors were also Orderliness/Conscientiousness and Honesty-Humility."</p>

            <p>"... we measure sensitivities to sexual and moral disgust, two domains that elicit self-reports of disgust and facial expressions of disgust... the degree to which individuals are 'sensitive' to disgust..."</p>
            <p>"... individual differences in disgust sensitivity might vary... people that relatively strongly avoid pathogens, and who pay the costs for doing so (e.g., by constraining diet and social interactions), may not be the same people that relatively strongly avoid fitness-compromising sexual interactions, and who pay distinct costs for doing so (e.g., search costs after rejecting mates), and they may not be the same people that relatively strongly condemn rule violations, and who pay other distinct costs for doing so (e.g., retribution from condemnation targets and their allies...</p>
            <p>"... indicated that individual differences vary along three dimensions, one of which included items similar to those on Haidt et al.'s (1994) Disgust Scale (cues to pathogens, such as feces, mold, and wounds), one of which included sexual items (e.g., being touched on the thigh by a stranger), and one of which included moral violations (e.g., lying, cheating, stealing)... the Three Domain Disgust Scale (TDDS)."</p>
            <p>"Consistent with past studies using the TDDS, participant sex was strongly related to Sexual Disgust (d = 1.07), but not Pathogen Disgust or Moral Disgust. Age was related to both Sexual Disgust (r = .29) and Moral Disgust (r = .20)."</p>
            <p>"For the HEXACO PI-R, the strongest correlate of Pathogen Disgust was Emotionality (r = .23), the strongest correlates of Sexual Disgust were Honesty-humility and Emotionality (both r's = .31) and the strongest correlate of Moral Disgust was honesty-humility (r = .32)."</p>
            <p>"For the 5DPT [Big 5], the strongest correlate of Pathogen Disgust was Orderliness (r = .16), the strongest correlate of Sexual Disgust was Insensitivity (r = .21), and the strongest correlate of Moral Disgust was Orderliness (r = .22)."</p>
            <p>"In all six equations, personality explained variance in disgust sensitivity independent of participant sex and age. For Pathogen Disgust, the two significant andâ€”across personality modelsâ€”consistent personality predictors were Neuroticism/Emotionality and Orderliness/Conscientiousness. For Sexual Disgust, the two consistent personality predictors were Orderliness/Conscientiousness and Honesty-Humility. For Moral Disgust, the two consistent personality predictors were also Orderliness/Conscientiousness and Honesty-Humility."</p>
            <p>"Results here not only provide further support that individual differences in sensitivities to these three types of disgust are also distinct; they also provide indications of how they are distinct in terms of their relationships with broad personality dimensions."</p>
            <p>"... results offer clarifications on how to interpret sensitivities to sexual and moral disgust. Our results suggest that sensitivities to these two disgust domains are most strongly related to honestyâ€“humility rather than agreeableness. Hence, rather than being more forgiving, flexible, gentle, and patient (how Agreeableness is defined in the HEXACO model), individuals who are more sensitive to sexual and moral disgust are more sincere, fair, greed-avoidant, and modest. The unique relationship between sensitivities to sexual and moral disgustâ€”and the nonsignificant unique relationship between these disgust domains and Agreeableness, once controlling for Honestyâ€“Humilityâ€”was observed using personality measures based on the HEXACO model and the FFM."</p>
            <p>"It appears that there is a consistent, though weak, relationship between sensitivity to pathogen disgust and neuroticism/emotionality."</p>
