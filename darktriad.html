                <p>"... narcissists... are likely to enter into conflict... "</p>
                <p>"Zeiger-Hill and Marcus (2016) argued that personality traits should be considered dark when "they are linked with interpersonal difficulties across a variety of contexts even when only modest levels of these features are present..."
                <p>"Have difficulties understanding their emotional experiences... struggle with accepting negative emotions, often having negative secondary emotions in response to their feelings..."</p>
                <p>In this they argue for more dark triad traits outside of the core three of; sadism, spitefulness, status-driven risk taking, egoism, moral disengagement, psychological entitlement, and self interest.</p>
                <p>"In relation to the Dark Triad, the most relevant Big Five/FFM factor is Agreeableness... provided evidence that the traits associated with the core of the Dark Triad were not distinictive from low agreeableness (ie, antagonism).</p>
                <p>"In the HEXACO framework, eXtraversion, Conscientiousness, and Openness to experience are quite similar to their Big Five/FFM counterparts. However, Emotionality and Agreeableness represent rotated versions of Big Five/FFM Neuroticism and Agreeableness, respectively. The anger/hostility aspects of Big Five/FFM (high) Neuroticism are encompassed by HEXACO (low) Agreeableness. Honesty-Humility overlaps with Big Five/FFM Agreeableness but also contains unique content that is not accounted for within the Big Five/FFM."</p>
                <p>"Paulhaus and Williams noted that all three Dark Triad traits were characterized by low Big Five Agreeableness... however Visser... found that though Machiavellianism, psychopoathy and SDRT [Status-Driven Risk Taking] were characterized by low Big Five Agreeableness, narcissism was not."</p>
                <p>"Other core explanations for the common element of the Dark Triad are callousness... a fast and exploitative life history strategy... and HEXACO Honesty-Humility..."</p>
                <p>"Despite the widespread perception of Dark Triad traits as maladaptive, Jonason et all (2012b) argued that these traits would have some benefits that would be associated with reproductive fitness..."</p>
                <p>"HEXACO best accounted for the overlap between the Dark Triad (Book et al., 2015). While low Honesty-Humiity was most central, low Emotionality, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness and high eXtraversion were also relevant."</p>
                <p>"Not all of the dark personality traits were most strongly charactized by low Honesty-Humility (Book et al., 2016). Narcissism, for example, was most strongly related to high eXtraversion, and everyday sadism was highly related to low Emotionality as well as low Honesty-Humility."</p>
