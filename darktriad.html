                <p>"... narcissists... are likely to enter into conflict... "</p>
                <p>"Zeiger-Hill and Marcus (2016) argued that personality traits should be considered dark when "they are linked with interpersonal difficulties across a variety of contexts even when only modest levels of these features are present..."
                <p>"Have difficulties understanding their emotional experiences... struggle with accepting negative emotions, often having negative secondary emotions in response to their feelings..."</p>
                <p>In this they argue for more dark triad traits outside of the core three of; sadism, spitefulness, status-driven risk taking, egoism, moral disengagement, psychological entitlement, and self interest.</p>
                <p>"In relation to the Dark Triad, the most relevant Big Five/FFM factor is Agreeableness... provided evidence that the traits associated with the core of the Dark Triad were not distinictive from low agreeableness (ie, antagonism).</p>
                <p>"In the HEXACO framework, eXtraversion, Conscientiousness, and Openness to experience are quite similar to their Big Five/FFM counterparts. However, Emotionality and Agreeableness represent rotated versions of Big Five/FFM Neuroticism and Agreeableness, respectively. The anger/hostility aspects of Big Five/FFM (high) Neuroticism are encompassed by HEXACO (low) Agreeableness. Honesty-Humility overlaps with Big Five/FFM Agreeableness but also contains unique content that is not accounted for within the Big Five/FFM."</p>
                <p>"Paulhaus and Williams noted that all three Dark Triad traits were characterized by low Big Five Agreeableness... however Visser... found that though Machiavellianism, psychopoathy and SDRT [Status-Driven Risk Taking] were characterized by low Big Five Agreeableness, narcissism was not."</p>
                <p>"Other core explanations for the common element of the Dark Triad are callousness... a fast and exploitative life history strategy... and HEXACO Honesty-Humility..."</p>
                <p>"Despite the widespread perception of Dark Triad traits as maladaptive, Jonason et all (2012b) argued that these traits would have some benefits that would be associated with reproductive fitness..."</p>
                <p>"HEXACO best accounted for the overlap between the Dark Triad (Book et al., 2015). While low Honesty-Humiity was most central, low Emotionality, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness and high eXtraversion were also relevant."</p>
                <p>"Not all of the dark personality traits were most strongly charactized by low Honesty-Humility (Book et al., 2016). Narcissism, for example, was most strongly related to high eXtraversion, and everyday sadism was highly related to low Emotionality as well as low Honesty-Humility."</p>

            <p>"... externalizing problems can best be conceptualized in terms of two statistically independent dimensions: 'overt versus covert' and 'destructive versus non-destructive', which yield four types of disruptive behavior: (1) oppositionality (overt/non-destructive; e.g., anger, stubbornness, argumentativeness), (2) aggression (overt/destructive; e.g., spitefulness, fighting, bullying), (3) property violations (covert/destructive; e.g., vandalism, stealing, setting fire), and (4) status violations (covert/non-destructive; e.g., truancy, running away, breaking rules)."</p>

            <p>"The results of these investigations have indicated that both the Dark Triad traits and honesty-humility account for a statistically significant proportion of the variance in aggression... and malevolent tendencies in relation to domains of sex, power, and money..."</p>

            <p>"... all three Dark Triad traits were positively correlated with each other (rs between 0.21 and 0.58, psâ€‰<â€‰0.05)... "</p>
            <p>"... Dark Triad traits were also found to be consistently and significantly negatively associated with a number of other HEXACO personality factors including agreeableness (rs between âˆ’0.36 and âˆ’0.48, psâ€‰<â€‰0.001), emotionality (rs between âˆ’0.25 and âˆ’0.47, psâ€‰<â€‰0.05), and conscientiousness (rs between âˆ’0.22 and âˆ’0.43, psâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Finally, agreeableness (rs being âˆ’0.67 and âˆ’0.49, psâ€‰<â€‰0.001), emotionality (rs being âˆ’0.33 and âˆ’0.45, psâ€‰<â€‰0.05), and conscientiousness (rs being âˆ’0.22 and âˆ’0.39, psâ€‰<â€‰0.05) were also significantly negatively correlated with symptoms of ODD and CD....</p>
            <p>"The first regression analysis with Dark Triad traits and honesty-humility as predictor variables revealed that these variables accounted for 28% of the variance of this type of externalizing problem... only psychopathy made a significant unique contribution to ODD symptoms."</p>
            <p>"... conducted with Dark Triad traits, honesty-humility, as well as other HEXACO factors as predictor variables. These personality traits/factors jointly explained 50% of the variance in ODD... value for psychopathy was again positive, the contributions of agreeableness and extraversion were negative, which indicates that lower levels of these personality factors were associated with higher levels of ODD symptoms."</p>
            <p>"... the Dark Triad traits, honesty-humility, and other HEXACO factors as predictors, all personality features jointly accounted for 41% of the variance in CD symptoms..."</p>
            <p>"... positive correlations were found between the Dark Triad traits and symptoms of ODD and CD, whereas negative correlations were noted between honesty-humility and both types of externalizing problems."</p>
            <p>"... ODD and CD symptoms were predicted from all measured personality traits revealed that besides the Dark Triad and honesty-humility, other HEXACO traits also made unique and significant contributions explaining additional variance of these externalizing problems. In the model of ODD symptoms, the percentage of explained variance increased with no less than 22%, with agreeableness and extraversion emerging as additional significant predictors.."</p>

            <p>"Among the DT traits, psychopathy emerged as the best predictor of both functions of aggression. However, in line with some previous studies... psychopathy showed stronger relations with proactive than reactive aggression, and this was the case in both male and female subsamples."</p>
            <p>"Although Machiavellianism was related to both functions of aggression in both subsamples, it had a more substantial contribution to the explanation of reactive aggression... it can be assumed that Machiavellians could also show impulsive, reactive aggression in egoâ€“provoked situations..."</p>
